While deep learning can seem overwhelming to newcomers, it is fundamentally a series of simple matrix operations. A single layer of this operation can be reduced to the softmax classifier. In this project, I build a softmax classifier from scratch, displaying the mathematical concepts that are fundamental to deep learning.
